Robot Nexus: AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant

Overview

Robot Nexus is a smart healthcare assistant robot we're developing to help improve medical care, especially in areas where doctors are few or overwhelmed. It's shaped like an egg, moves on wheels, and has a screen and sensors to interact with patients.

Key Features

- Patients insert their hospital RFID card into the robot
- The robot reads their ID and pulls their medical records from a secure cloud database
- It checks the patient's vital signs (like temperature, blood pressure, heart rate)
- It asks the patient about their symptoms using AI, and provides a preliminary diagnosis
- It then writes a medical report, suggests tests or medications, and updates the patient's health record
- Doctors can later access this report on their computer and even talk to the patient through the robot remotely if needed

Technologies Used

- Powerful AI tools like voice recognition and diagnosis
- Secure data sharing and cloud infrastructure for medical records
- Robotic hardware including wheels, sensors, and interactive screen

Goals

Our goal is to help doctors do more with less and ensure that everyone gets the care they need, no matter where they are. We're aiming to deploy Robot Nexus in hospitals, clinics, and rural communities with limited access to healthcare.
